This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
library(raster)
library(tidyverse)

raw.df <- raster('gpw-v4-population-density-adjusted-to-2015-unwpp-country-totals-rev11_2020_1_deg_asc/gpw_v4_population_density_adjusted_to_2015_unwpp_country_totals_rev11_2020_1_deg.asc')

```

```{r}
df <- rasterToPoints(raw.df) %>%
  as.data.frame(df, xy=TRUE) %>%
  rename('pop' = 'gpw_v4_population_density_adjusted_to_2015_unwpp_country_totals_rev11_2020_1_deg' )

head(df)
write.csv(df, "world-pop-density.csv")
```
